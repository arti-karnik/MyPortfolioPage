# MyPortfolioPage

<strong> Project Summary: </strong> <br>
I have had great fun to build on the first assignment & work on this one utilizing advanced HTML, CSS & Bootstrap concepts. Understood & successfully
applied concepts like static header, footers & more importantly a web & mobile responsive page.
I look forward to deep diving into JavaScript, having fun learning what it's all about & more importantly applying the learning to develop & build further more professional looking webpages.

<strong> Description: </strong>
1. In this exercise, I have developed a multiple page portfolio utilizing HTML, CSS & Bootstrap learnings & concepts. This is web & mobile responsive - 
meaning the page content, menus will resize if browser window size or zoom is changed or operation system zoom is increased or decreased as well as if
a user were to access the web page on a mobile device and it's supported browser.

2. This portfolio consists of five different pages. On the home page, these are arranged in a tab like structure on a common header - 
each having it's own .html page. The header appears on every page & has the same css properties.

3. Home : This has a background image, my name & a one liner description of my professional background.

4. About : Photo added in the left panel along with brief description of my profressional qualifications & other details such as email & phone contact, 
address & incorporated social media links. These links have currently not been linked to my actual profile on those respective websites.

5. Portfolio : This page currently has placeholders of future assignments/work to be showcased.

6. Resume : This has a summary of my skills, professional experience & education.

7. Contact : This page will allow users on the web to contact me for my services if desired. This is done through a simple form & all of it's fields
are required. Currently validation will show one field at a time if left empty & if 'Submit' is clicked. I have used google api's to embed a small 
map of the location/address.

8. On all of the tabs/html pages other than 'Home', I have incorporated a static footer that has basic copyright information with my name in it.

9. When the browser window size is reduced to a point where the page becomes responsive or this page were to be accessed on a mobile browser, the menu 
tabs are converted to a drop down menu which is shown with a 3-horizontal line icon in top right corner of the page. Clicking on it opens or closes the 
menu options & available pages can be accessed from here.

10. Clicking on my name link in top left corner of the page will redirect to the 'Home' (index.html) page.

11. Unit tested the page on Windows (Chrome, IE11 & Edge) & MAC to ensure that the layout is consistent in full view as well as in the responsive mode.
